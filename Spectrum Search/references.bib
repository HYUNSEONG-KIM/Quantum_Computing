	abstract = {We propose an imaginary time equivalent of the well-established Pauli gadget primitive for Trotter-decomposed real time evolution, using mid-circuit measurements on a single ancilla qubit. Imaginary time evolution (ITE) is widely used for obtaining the ground state of a system on classical hardware, computing thermal averages, and as a component of quantum algorithms that perform non-unitary evolution. Near-term implementations on quantum hardware rely on heuristics, compromising their accuracy. As a result, there is growing interest in the development of more natively quantum algorithms. Since it is not possible to implement a non-unitary gate deterministically, we resort to the implementation of probabilistic imaginary time evolution (PITE) algorithms, which rely on a unitary quantum circuit to simulate a block encoding of the ITE operator - that is, they rely on successful ancillary measurements to evolve the system non-unitarily. Compared with previous PITE proposals, the suggested block encoding in this paper results in shorter circuits and is simpler to implement, requiring only a slight modification of the Pauli gadget primitive. This scheme was tested on the transverse Ising model and the fermionic Hubbard model and is demonstrated to converge to the ground state of the system.},
