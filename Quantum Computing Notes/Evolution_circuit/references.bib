	abstract = {This paper assesses the performance of the D-Wave 2X (DW) quantum annealer for finding a maximum clique in a graph, one of the most fundamental and important NP-hard problems. Because the size of the largest graphs DW can directly solve is quite small (usually around 45 vertices), we also consider decomposition algorithms intended for larger graphs and analyze their performance. For smaller graphs that fit DW, we provide formulations of the maximum clique problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which is one of the two input types (together with the Ising model) acceptable by the machine, and compare several quantum implementations to current classical algorithms such as simulated annealing, Gurobi, and third-party clique finding heuristics. We further estimate the contributions of the quantum phase of the quantum annealer and the classical post-processing phase typically used to enhance each solution returned by DW. We demonstrate that on random graphs that fit DW, no quantum speedup can be observed compared with the classical algorithms. On the other hand, for instances specifically designed to fit well the DW qubit interconnection network, we observe substantial speed-ups in computing time over classical approaches.},

	abstract = {There exists a large class of groups of operators acting on Hilbert spaces, where commutativity of group elements can be expressed in the geometric language of symplectic polar spaces embedded in the projective spaces PG(\$n, p\$), \$n\$ being odd and \$p\$ a prime. Here, we present a result about commuting and non-commuting group elements based on the existence of so-called Moebius pairs of \$n\$-simplices, i. e., pairs of \$n\$-simplices which are {\textbackslash}emph\{mutually inscribed and circumscribed\} to each other. For group elements representing an \$n\$-simplex there is no element outside the centre which commutes with all of them. This allows to express the dimension \$n\$ of the associated polar space in group theoretic terms. Any Moebius pair of \$n\$-simplices according to our construction corresponds to two disjoint families of group elements (operators) with the following properties: (i) Any two distinct elements of the same family do not commute. (ii) Each element of one family commutes with all but one of the elements from the other family. A three-qubit generalised Pauli group serves as a non-trivial example to illustrate the theory for \$p=2\$ and \$n=5\$.},

We detail an algorithm to completely partition the full set of Pauli strings acting on any number of qubits into the minimal number of sets of commuting families, and we provide python code to perform the partitioning. The partitioning method scales linearly with the size of the set of Pauli strings and it naturally provides a fast method of diagonalizing the commuting families with quantum gates. We provide a package that integrates the partitioning into Qiskit, and use this to benchmark the algorithm with dense Hamiltonians, such as those that arise in matrix quantum mechanics models, on IBM hardware. We demonstrate computational speedups close to the theoretical limit of \$(3/2){\textasciicircum}m\$ relative to qubit-wise commuting groupings, for \$m=2,{\textbackslash}dotsc,6\$ qubits.},

	abstract = {The variational method is a versatile tool for classical simulation of a variety of quantum systems. Great efforts have recently been devoted to its extension to quantum computing for efficiently solving static many-body problems and simulating real and imaginary time dynamics. In this work, we first review the conventional variational principles, including the Rayleigh-Ritz method for solving static problems, and the Dirac and Frenkel variational principle, the McLachlan's variational principle, and the time-dependent variational principle, for simulating real time dynamics. We focus on the simulation of dynamics and discuss the connections of the three variational principles. Previous works mainly focus on the unitary evolution of pure states. In this work, we introduce variational quantum simulation of mixed states under general stochastic evolution. We show how the results can be reduced to the pure state case with a correction term that takes accounts of global phase alignment. For variational simulation of imaginary time evolution, we also extend it to the mixed state scenario and discuss variational Gibbs state preparation. We further elaborate on the design of ansatz that is compatible with post-selection measurement and the implementation of the generalised variational algorithms with quantum circuits. Our work completes the theory of variational quantum simulation of general real and imaginary time evolution and it is applicable to near-term quantum hardware.},

With the standard correspondence between the Foch space of m LFMs and the Hilbert space of m qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes O(m) qubit gates and vice versa. We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to O(log m) and a constant, respectively. Nearest neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a constant cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found. We also study computation with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of LFMs. Some connection to qubit quantum codes is made.},
