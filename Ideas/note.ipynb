    "The computation model of special function in classical computer requires many techniques and mostly they are iterative methods. Furthermore, they are sperately treating analytic continuation via different algorithms.\n",
    "The importance of special function in Physics is that they arise in many differential equations describing important physical systems. We know that the qubit system is well-controlled quantum system we have. If we are possible to imitate quantum system via quantum computer, then the special functions could be approximated via qubit-gate operations.\n",
